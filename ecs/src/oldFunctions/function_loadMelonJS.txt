Prompt: 1 / 1Make the loadMelonJS return a promise. Set script.type to be a
module.
Answer: 1 / 1Certainly! Here's an updated loadMelonJS function that
returns a Promise and sets the type of the script to be a module:javascriptCopy
codefunction loadMelonJS() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
const script = document.createElement('script');
    script.type = 'module';
script.src = 'https://esm.run/melonjs';
    script.addEventListener('load', ()
=> {
      resolve();
    });
    script.addEventListener('error', () => {
reject(new Error('Failed to load melonJS'));
    });
document.head.appendChild(script);
  });
}

loadMelonJS()
  .then(() => {
console.log('melonJS has been loaded!');
    // additional code can be added
here to use melonJS
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
});
This function creates a new Promise that resolves when the melonJS script
has finished loading, and rejects if there is an error. The type of the script
is set to module to indicate that it is an ECMAScript module. Once the script
has loaded, the load event is fired and the Promise resolves. If there is an
error, the error event is fired and the Promise rejects with an error message.By
returning the Promise, the calling code can use .then() and .catch() to handle
successful and failed loading of the melonJS script, respectively.
