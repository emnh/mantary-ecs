Prompt: 1 / 1Write a js function that says moo.
Answer: 1 / 1Sure, here's a
simple JavaScript function that says "moo" when called:javascriptCopy
codefunction sayMoo() {
  console.log("moo");
}
When you call this function, it
will log the message "moo" to the console:javascriptCopy codesayMoo(); // logs
"moo" to the console
Of course, you can modify this function to do something
else with the "moo" message, such as displaying it on the screen or speaking it
out loud using a text-to-speech library.
