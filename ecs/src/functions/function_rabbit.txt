Prompt: 1 / 1assume a function called rabbit exists. create a js main function
that calls it.
Answer: 1 / 1Sure, here's an example of how you could create a
main() function in JavaScript that calls a function named rabbit:javascriptCopy
codefunction rabbit() {
  console.log("I am a rabbit!");
}

function main() {
rabbit();
}

main();
Saved mainThis code defines a rabbit() function that logs
the message "I am a rabbit!" to the console. It also defines a main() function
that calls rabbit().When the main() function is called, it will execute the
rabbit() function and print the message to the console.You can replace the
rabbit() function with any other function that you want to call from main().
