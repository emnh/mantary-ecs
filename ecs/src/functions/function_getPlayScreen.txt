Prompt: 1 / 1Forgive me, the image is named ../images/platform2.png
Answer: 1 /
1No problem at all! Here's an updated getPlayScreen function that uses the
corrected path to the platform image:javascriptCopy codefunction getPlayScreen()
{
  class PlayScreen extends me.Stage {
    /**
     * Constructor
     */
constructor() {
      super();
    }

    /**
     * Called when the state is
first initialized
     */
    onResetEvent() {
      // Add any game objects or
UI elements here
      const platformImage =
me.loader.getImage('../images/platform2.png');
      drawPlatform(me.game, 100,
400, 200, 50, platformImage);
    }

    /**
     * Called when the state is
destroyed
     */
    onDestroyEvent() {
      // Clean up any game objects or
UI elements here
    }
  }

  return PlayScreen;
}
In this updated code,
me.loader.getImage('../images/platform2.png') is used to load the platform image
from the corrected path. The resulting image object is passed to the
drawPlatform function as the image parameter, along with the specified x, y,
width, and height parameters.This will draw a platform on the screen using the
corrected image path.
