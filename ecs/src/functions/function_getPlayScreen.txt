Prompt: 1 / 1I think you meant to set this.player = player in the constructor
and refer to it in follow.
Answer: 1 / 1You are correct, my apologies for the
confusion. In order to use the player entity in the follow method of the
me.game.viewport, you need to set it as a property of the PlayScreen
instance.Here's the updated implementation of getPlayScreen with the correct
reference to the player entity:javascriptCopy codefunction getPlayScreen(images)
{
  const PlayerEntity = getPlayerEntity();

  class PlayScreen extends me.Stage
{
    constructor() {
      super();
      this.backgroundColor = '#202020';
drawPlatform(me.game.world, 0, 500, 800, 100, images.platform);
      const
player = new PlayerEntity(0, 0, {
        image: images.player,
        width:
64,
        height: 64,
      });
      player.renderable.scale(2, 2);
player.body.gravityScale = 0;
      player.body.collisionType =
me.collision.types.PLAYER_OBJECT;
      player.body.vel.x = 3;
player.body.vel.y = 3;
      me.game.world.addChild(player);

      // set the
player as a property of the PlayScreen instance
      this.player = player;
}

    onResetEvent() {
      const { PlayScreen } = me.state;
me.input.bindKey(me.input.KEY.LEFT, "left");
me.input.bindKey(me.input.KEY.RIGHT, "right");
me.input.bindKey(me.input.KEY.UP, "jump", true);
me.input.bindKey(me.input.KEY.SPACE, "shoot");

      // use the player property
in the follow method
      me.game.viewport.follow(PlayScreen.player.pos,
me.game.viewport.AXIS.BOTH);
      me.game.viewport.setDeadzone(30, 30);
    }
}
  return PlayScreen;
}
In the updated implementation, getPlayScreen sets the
player entity as a property of the PlayScreen instance using this.player =
player in the constructor. The player property is then used in the follow method
of the me.game.viewport.
