Prompt: 1 / 1Try prefixing the image with /public/
Answer: 1 / 1Sure thing!
Here's an updated getPlayScreen function that prefixes the image path with
/public/:javascriptCopy codefunction getPlayScreen() {
  class PlayScreen
extends me.Stage {
    /**
     * Constructor
     */
    constructor() {
super();
    }

    /**
     * Called when the state is first initialized
*/
    onResetEvent() {
      // Add any game objects or UI elements here
const platformImage = me.loader.getImage('/public/images/platform2.png');
if (!platformImage) {
        console.error("Failed to load platform image!");
return;
      }
      drawPlatform(me.game, 100, 400, 200, 50,
platformImage);
    }

    /**
     * Called when the state is destroyed
*/
    onDestroyEvent() {
      // Clean up any game objects or UI elements
here
    }
  }

  return PlayScreen;
}
In this updated code, /public/ is added
to the beginning of the image path. This assumes that the images directory is
located in a public directory that is located at the root of your server.If the
image is successfully loaded, it is passed to the drawPlatform function to draw
the platform on the screen.If the image cannot be loaded, an error message is
logged to the console and the function returns without drawing the platform.This
should help to ensure that the platform image is found, regardless of the
specific file structure of your project.
