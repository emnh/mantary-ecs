Prompt: 1 / 1Write a getImage function that takes an URL and returns a promise
which resolves to the image. Await this function in getPlayScreen.
Answer: 1 /
1Sure! Here's an updated getPlayScreen function that uses an getImage function
to load the platform image as a Promise:javascriptCopy codeasync function
getImage(url) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const image =
new Image();
    image.onload = () => resolve(image);
    image.onerror = (err)
=> reject(err);
    image.src = url;
  });
}

async function getPlayScreen() {
class PlayScreen extends me.Stage {
    /**
     * Constructor
     */
constructor() {
      super();
    }

    /**
     * Called when the state is
first initialized
     */
    async onResetEvent() {
      // Add any game
objects or UI elements here
      const platformImage = await
getImage('/images/platform2');
      if (!platformImage) {
console.error("Failed to load platform image!");
        return;
      }
drawPlatform(me.game, 100, 400, 200, 50, platformImage);
    }

    /**
     *
Called when the state is destroyed
     */
    onDestroyEvent() {
      // Clean
up any game objects or UI elements here
    }
  }

  return PlayScreen;
}
In
this updated code, an getImage function is defined that takes a URL as an
argument and returns a Promise that resolves to an image object. The getImage
function uses the Image constructor to create a new image object, sets up an
onload event listener to resolve the Promise when the image has loaded, and sets
the image's src property to the specified URL.In the onResetEvent method of the
PlayScreen class, the getImage function is used to load the platform image as a
Promise. When the Promise resolves, the image object is passed to the
drawPlatform function to draw the platform on the screen.If the image cannot be
loaded, an error message is logged to the console and the function returns
without drawing the platform.Using Promises in this way can help to ensure that
your code runs asynchronously and that your application remains responsive even
when loading large or complex assets.
