Prompt: 1 / 1Try without .png on the end.
Answer: 1 / 1Sure thing! Here's an
updated getPlayScreen function that loads the platform image without the .png
file extension:javascriptCopy codefunction getPlayScreen() {
  class PlayScreen
extends me.Stage {
    /**
     * Constructor
     */
    constructor() {
super();
    }

    /**
     * Called when the state is first initialized
*/
    onResetEvent() {
      // Add any game objects or UI elements here
const platformImage = me.loader.getImage('/public/images/platform2');
      if
(!platformImage) {
        console.error("Failed to load platform image!");
return;
      }
      drawPlatform(me.game, 100, 400, 200, 50,
platformImage);
    }

    /**
     * Called when the state is destroyed
*/
    onDestroyEvent() {
      // Clean up any game objects or UI elements
here
    }
  }

  return PlayScreen;
}
In this updated code, the file extension
.png is removed from the image path. This assumes that the image file is named
platform2 without any file extension.If the image is successfully loaded, it is
passed to the drawPlatform function to draw the platform on the screen.If the
image cannot be loaded, an error message is logged to the console and the
function returns without drawing the platform.This should help to ensure that
the platform image is found, regardless of the specific file naming conventions
used in your project.
