Prompt: 1 / 1Update the getPlayScreen function to try
/images/platform2.png
Answer: 1 / 1Sure! Here's an updated getPlayScreen
function that tries both ../images/platform2.png and
/images/platform2.png:javascriptCopy codefunction getPlayScreen() {
  class
PlayScreen extends me.Stage {
    /**
     * Constructor
     */
constructor() {
      super();
    }

    /**
     * Called when the state is
first initialized
     */
    onResetEvent() {
      // Add any game objects or
UI elements here
      let platformImage =
me.loader.getImage('../images/platform2.png');
      if (!platformImage) {
platformImage = me.loader.getImage('/images/platform2.png');
      }
      if
(!platformImage) {
        console.error("Failed to load platform image!");
return;
      }
      drawPlatform(me.game, 100, 400, 200, 50,
platformImage);
    }

    /**
     * Called when the state is destroyed
*/
    onDestroyEvent() {
      // Clean up any game objects or UI elements
here
    }
  }

  return PlayScreen;
}
In this updated code,
me.loader.getImage('../images/platform2.png') is used to load the platform image
from the original path, and me.loader.getImage('/images/platform2.png') is used
to load the platform image from a new path that starts with a leading slash
(/).If the image is successfully loaded from either path, it is passed to the
drawPlatform function to draw the platform on the screen.If the image cannot be
loaded from either path, an error message is logged to the console and the
function returns without drawing the platform.This should help to ensure that
the platform image is found, regardless of the specific file structure of your
project.
