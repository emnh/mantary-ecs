Prompt: 1 / 1Now define getPlayScreen which returns a class. The class is
defined using class PlayScreen extends me.Stage {}.
Answer: 1 / 1Certainly!
Here's an example of a getPlayScreen function that returns a class PlayScreen
defined using class PlayScreen extends me.Stage {}:javascriptCopy codefunction
getPlayScreen() {
  class PlayScreen extends me.Stage {
    /**
     *
Constructor
     */
    constructor() {
      super();
    }

    /**
     *
Called when the state is first initialized
     */
    onResetEvent() {
      //
Add any game objects or UI elements here
      drawRectangle(me.game.world, 100,
100, 50, 50, '#FF0000');
    }

    /**
     * Called when the state is
destroyed
     */
    onDestroyEvent() {
      // Clean up any game objects or
UI elements here
    }
  }

  return PlayScreen;
}
This function returns a class
PlayScreen that extends me.Stage, which is a base class for melonJS game states.
The PlayScreen class has two methods: onResetEvent and onDestroyEvent, which are
called when the state is first initialized and destroyed, respectively.The
onResetEvent method is where game objects and UI elements should be added to the
screen. In this example, we call the drawRectangle function to draw a red
rectangle on the screen.The onDestroyEvent method is called when the state is
destroyed, and is where any cleanup should be performed.Note that this code
assumes that the drawRectangle function has already been defined, and that it
takes the game object as its first parameter. You may need to modify this code
to fit your specific use case.
