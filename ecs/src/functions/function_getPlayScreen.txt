Prompt: 1 / 1Try without /public
Answer: 1 / 1Sure! Here's an updated
getPlayScreen function that loads the platform image without the /public
prefix:javascriptCopy codefunction getPlayScreen() {
  class PlayScreen extends
me.Stage {
    /**
     * Constructor
     */
    constructor() {
super();
    }

    /**
     * Called when the state is first initialized
*/
    onResetEvent() {
      // Add any game objects or UI elements here
const platformImage = me.loader.getImage('/images/platform2');
      if
(!platformImage) {
        console.error("Failed to load platform image!");
return;
      }
      drawPlatform(me.game, 100, 400, 200, 50,
platformImage);
    }

    /**
     * Called when the state is destroyed
*/
    onDestroyEvent() {
      // Clean up any game objects or UI elements
here
    }
  }

  return PlayScreen;
}
In this updated code, the /public prefix
is removed from the image path. This assumes that the images directory is
located in the root directory of your server, and that the platform image is
located at /images/platform2.If the image is successfully loaded, it is passed
to the drawPlatform function to draw the platform on the screen.If the image
cannot be loaded, an error message is logged to the console and the function
returns without drawing the platform.This should help to ensure that the
platform image is found, regardless of the specific file structure of your
project.
