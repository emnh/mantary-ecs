Prompt: 1 / 1Update getPlayScreen to take images and to look up platform2.png in
the dictionary.
Answer: 1 / 1Sure thing! Here's an updated implementation of
getPlayScreen that takes an images object as an argument and looks up
platform2.png in the dictionary:javascriptCopy codefunction
getPlayScreen(images) {
  class PlayScreen extends me.Stage {
    /**
     *
Constructor
     */
    constructor() {
      super();
    }

    /**
     *
Called when the state is first initialized
     */
    onResetEvent() {
      //
Add any game objects or UI elements here
      const platformImage =
images['/images/platform2.png'];
      if (!platformImage) {
console.error("Failed to load platform image!");
        return;
      }
drawPlatform(me.game, 100, 400, 200, 50, platformImage);
    }

    /**
     *
Called when the state is destroyed
     */
    onDestroyEvent() {
      // Clean
up any game objects or UI elements here
    }
  }

  return PlayScreen;
}
In
this updated implementation, the getPlayScreen function takes an images object
as its argument.In the onResetEvent method of the PlayScreen class, we use the
images object to look up the platform2.png image using its URL as the dictionary
key. If the image is found, we pass it to the drawPlatform function to draw the
platform on the screen. If the image is not found, we log an error message to
the console and return without drawing the platform.This implementation should
allow you to load and use images more efficiently by storing them in a
dictionary and passing the dictionary to the game screens that need them.
