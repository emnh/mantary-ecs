Prompt: 1 / 1Instead of calling to draw a rectangle, draw a platform instead.
Use './images/platform2.png' for the image.
Answer: 1 / 1Sure! Here's an updated
getPlayScreen function that uses the drawPlatform function to draw a platform
with the specified image:javascriptCopy codefunction getPlayScreen() {
  class
PlayScreen extends me.Stage {
    /**
     * Constructor
     */
constructor() {
      super();
    }

    /**
     * Called when the state is
first initialized
     */
    onResetEvent() {
      // Add any game objects or
UI elements here
      const platformImage =
me.loader.getImage('./images/platform2.png');
      drawPlatform(me.game, 100,
400, 200, 50, platformImage);
    }

    /**
     * Called when the state is
destroyed
     */
    onDestroyEvent() {
      // Clean up any game objects or
UI elements here
    }
  }

  return PlayScreen;
}
In this updated code,
me.loader.getImage('./images/platform2.png') is used to load the platform image
from the specified path, and the resulting image object is passed to the
drawPlatform function as the image parameter. The drawPlatform function is
called with the specified x, y, width, and height parameters, as well as the
loaded image.This will draw a platform on the screen using the specified image.
Note that this assumes that the image file is located in the ./images/ directory
relative to the HTML file that includes the melonJS game. You may need to modify
the path to the image file to match your specific file structure.
