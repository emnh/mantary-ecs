Prompt: 1 / 1You should pass me.game to drawRectangle, not
me.game.world.
Answer: 1 / 1You're absolutely right! Thank you for catching that
mistake. Here's an updated getPlayScreen function that passes me.game to
drawRectangle instead of me.game.world:javascriptCopy codefunction
getPlayScreen() {
  class PlayScreen extends me.Stage {
    /**
     *
Constructor
     */
    constructor() {
      super();
    }

    /**
     *
Called when the state is first initialized
     */
    onResetEvent() {
      //
Add any game objects or UI elements here
      drawRectangle(me.game, 100, 100,
50, 50, '#FF0000');
    }

    /**
     * Called when the state is destroyed
*/
    onDestroyEvent() {
      // Clean up any game objects or UI elements
here
    }
  }

  return PlayScreen;
}
In this updated code, drawRectangle is
called with me.game as its first parameter instead of me.game.world. This
ensures that the rectangle is added to the me.game object itself, rather than to
a specific container within the game world.Thank you for catching that mistake,
and I apologize for any confusion it may have caused.
