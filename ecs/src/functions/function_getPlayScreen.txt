Prompt: 1 / 1In the constructor add the line "me.game.viewport.follow(this,
me.game.viewport.AXIS.BOTH, 0.1);" and forget about the other follow
line.
Answer: 1 / 1Sure, here's the updated implementation of the getPlayScreen
function with the updated follow method:javascriptCopy codefunction
getPlayScreen(images) {
  const PlayerEntity = getPlayerEntity();

  class
PlayScreen extends me.Stage {
    constructor() {
      super();
this.backgroundColor = '#202020';

      drawPlatform(me.game.world, 0, 500,
800, 100, images.platform);
      const player = new PlayerEntity(0, 0, {
image: images.player,
        width: 64,
        height: 64,
      });
player.renderable.scale(2, 2);
      player.body.gravityScale = 0;
player.body.collisionType = me.collision.types.PLAYER_OBJECT;
player.body.vel.x = 3;
      player.body.vel.y = 3;
me.game.world.addChild(player);

      // set the player as a property of the
PlayScreen instance
      this.player = player;

      // follow the player with
the viewport
      me.game.viewport.follow(this, me.game.viewport.AXIS.BOTH,
0.1);
    }

    onResetEvent() {
      me.input.bindKey(me.input.KEY.LEFT,
"left");
      me.input.bindKey(me.input.KEY.RIGHT, "right");
me.input.bindKey(me.input.KEY.UP, "jump", true);
me.input.bindKey(me.input.KEY.SPACE, "shoot");
me.game.viewport.setDeadzone(30, 30);
    }
  }
  return PlayScreen;
}
In the
updated implementation, the getPlayScreen function now uses the
me.game.viewport.follow method to follow the PlayScreen instance with the
viewport. The follow method now takes three parameters - the first is the object
to follow (which is this in this case), the second is the axis to follow on
(both horizontal and vertical in this case), and the third is the damping rate
(which is set to 0.1). The other follow method call has been removed.
