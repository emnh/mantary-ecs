Prompt: 1 / 1You should use me.video.init instead of me.Game
Answer: 1 / 1You're
correct, thank you for pointing that out. Here's an updated initializeMelonJS
function that uses me.video.init instead of me.Game:javascriptCopy codefunction
initializeMelonJS(callback) {
  me.video.init(640, 480, {
    parent:
'game-container',
    renderer: me.video.CANVAS,
    scale: 'auto',
scaleMethod: 'fit'
  });
  
  const game = new me.Container();
me.game.world.addChild(game);
  
  // Load any assets here
  //
me.loader.preload({/*...*/});

  // Start the game loop
me.state.change(me.state.PLAY);
  
  callback(game);
}
Instead of using me.Game,
this function now uses me.video.init to initialize the video system for melonJS.
The me.video.init function takes three parameters: the width and height of the
game screen, and an options object that specifies the parent element, renderer,
and scaling method.Once the video system has been initialized, a new
me.Container object is created and added to the melonJS game world using
me.game.world.addChild. Any necessary assets can be loaded using
me.loader.preload (not shown in this example), and the game loop is started
using me.state.change(me.state.PLAY).As before, the callback function is called
with the game object once it has been created, allowing us to pass it to other
functions without needing to use a global variable.
