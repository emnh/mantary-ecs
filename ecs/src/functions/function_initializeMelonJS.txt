Prompt: 1 / 1Add the lines const PlayScreen = getPlayScreen();
me.state.set(me.state.PLAY, new PlayScreen()); before changing the
state.
Answer: 1 / 1Certainly! Here's an updated initializeMelonJS function that
creates a new PlayScreen object and sets it as the current game state before
starting the game loop:javascriptCopy codefunction initializeMelonJS(callback)
{
  me.video.init(640, 480, {
    parent: 'game-container',
    renderer:
me.video.CANVAS,
    scale: 'auto',
    scaleMethod: 'fit'
  });
  
  const game
= new me.Container();
  me.game.world.addChild(game);
  
  // Load any assets
here
  // me.loader.preload({/*...*/});

  const PlayScreen = getPlayScreen();
me.state.set(me.state.PLAY, new PlayScreen());
me.state.change(me.state.PLAY);
  
  callback(game);
}
The getPlayScreen
function should return a constructor for a me.ScreenObject that will act as the
main game screen. The initializeMelonJS function now calls getPlayScreen to get
a reference to the PlayScreen constructor and then creates a new instance of it
using new PlayScreen(). This new PlayScreen object is then set as the current
game state using me.state.set(me.state.PLAY, new PlayScreen()), before starting
the game loop using me.state.change(me.state.PLAY).Note that getPlayScreen is
assumed to return a valid constructor for a me.ScreenObject, and that PlayScreen
is used as an example. You may need to modify this code to fit your specific use
case.
