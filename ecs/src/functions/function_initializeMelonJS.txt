Prompt: 1 / 1I want to draw a rectangle on screen using melonjs. Write a
function drawRectangle which takes x, y, width, height and color. Come to think
of it, also write a function initializeMelonJS which does what the name
says.
Answer: 1 / 1Sure! Here are two functions: initializeMelonJS which sets up
the game and drawRectangle which can be used to draw a rectangle on the screen
using melonJS.javascriptCopy codelet game = null;

function initializeMelonJS()
{
  game = new me.Game({
    renderer: me.CanvasRenderer,
    width: 640,
height: 480,
    parent: 'game-container',
    title: 'My MelonJS Game'
  });
// Load any assets here
  // me.loader.preload({/*...*/});
  
  // Start the
game
  game.start();
}

function drawRectangle(x, y, width, height, color) {
const rect = new me.Renderable(x, y, width, height);
  rect.draw =
function(renderer) {
    renderer.setColor(color);
renderer.fillRect(this.pos.x, this.pos.y, this.width, this.height);
  };
game.world.addChild(rect);
}
The initializeMelonJS function sets up the game
using new me.Game and specifies the renderer to be used (me.CanvasRenderer), the
width and height of the game, and the title of the game. Any necessary assets
can be loaded using me.loader.preload (not shown in this example), and the game
is started using game.start().The drawRectangle function creates a new
me.Renderable object with the specified x, y, width, and height. The draw method
of the object is overridden to draw a filled rectangle using the specified
color. The rectangle object is added to the game world using
game.world.addChild(rect).Note that the game object is initialized outside of
these functions so that it can be accessed by both initializeMelonJS and
drawRectangle. It's also worth noting that this code assumes that melonJS has
already been loaded and that the me object is available in the global scope.
