Prompt: 1 / 1Let's call loadImages in initializeMelonJS and pass the image
dictionary to getPlayScreen.
Answer: 1 / 1Sure, we can modify the
initializeMelonJS function to call loadImages and pass the resulting image
dictionary to getPlayScreen. Here's an example implementation:javascriptCopy
codeasync function initializeMelonJS() {
  // Load MelonJS
  const melonScript =
await loadMelonJS();

  // Initialize MelonJS
  me.video.init(window.innerWidth,
window.innerHeight, { wrapper : "screen", scale : "auto", renderer :
me.video.CANVAS });
  me.audio.init("mp3,ogg");

  // Load images
  const
imageUrls = [
    '/images/platform2.png',
    '/images/player.png'
  ];
  const
images = await loadImages(imageUrls);

  // Set up game resources
me.loader.preload(images);

  // Set up game screens
me.state.set(me.state.PLAY, new (await getPlayScreen(images))());

  // Start
the game
  me.state.change(me.state.PLAY);
}
In this modified implementation, we
define an imageUrls array containing the URLs of the images we want to load. We
then call the loadImages function to load these images and store them in the
images object.We pass the images object as an argument to getPlayScreen, so that
it can be used to draw game objects or user interface elements that require the
loaded images.Finally, we call me.loader.preload(images) to ensure that all the
loaded images are preloaded and cached by the MelonJS loader, and we use await
to ensure that the game screens are only created and added to the game state
once all the images are loaded.This should help ensure that all required images
are loaded before the game screens are displayed, so that your game can run
smoothly and without any errors related to missing or unloaded images.
