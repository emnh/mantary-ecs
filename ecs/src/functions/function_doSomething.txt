Prompt: 1 / 1Are js classes first class objects?
Answer: 1 / 1Yes, JavaScript
classes are first-class objects. This means that, like any other object in
JavaScript, they can be passed as arguments to functions, returned from
functions, and assigned to variables or properties.In JavaScript, classes are
essentially syntactic sugar for constructor functions and prototype-based
inheritance. When a class is defined, it creates a constructor function and a
prototype object that is linked to the constructor's prototype property. This
prototype object contains all the methods and properties that are shared by
instances of the class.Since classes are just constructor functions and
prototype objects, they can be treated like any other object in JavaScript. For
example, you can pass a class as an argument to a function, like
this:javascriptCopy codefunction doSomething(classObject) {
  var obj = new
classObject();
  // do something with obj
}

doSomething(MyClass);
In this
example, MyClass is a class object that is passed as an argument to the
doSomething() function. The function then creates a new instance of the class
using the new keyword and assigns it to the obj variable.So, in summary,
JavaScript classes are first-class objects and can be treated like any other
object in JavaScript.
