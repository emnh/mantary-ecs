Prompt: 1 / 1Write a js function that takes a node and checks whether it is
contained in a function or is a top level function.
Answer: 1 / 1Here's an
example JavaScript function that takes a node object and checks whether it is
contained in a function or is a top-level function:javascriptCopy codefunction
checkFunctionLevel(node) {
  let current = node;
  while (current.parent !==
null) {
    current = current.parent;
    if (current.type ===
"FunctionDeclaration" || current.type === "FunctionExpression") {
      // The
node is contained in a function
      return "contained in a function";
    }
}
  // The node is a top-level function
  return "top-level function";
}
In this
example, the checkFunctionLevel() function takes a node object as its parameter.
The node object is assumed to have a parent property that points to its parent
node, and a type property that indicates its type (e.g., "FunctionDeclaration",
"FunctionExpression", etc.).The function then uses a while loop to traverse the
parent pointers until it reaches the root node (i.e., a node whose parent
property is null). At each step, it checks if the parent node is a function node
(i.e., a node with a type of "FunctionDeclaration" or "FunctionExpression"). If
it is, the function returns "contained in a function" to indicate that the node
is contained in a function. If the loop completes without finding a function
node, the function returns "top-level function" to indicate that the node is a
top-level function.You can call this function with a node object that has a
parent property pointing to its parent node and a type property indicating its
type, like this:javascriptCopy codeconst functionNode = {
  type:
"FunctionDeclaration",
  parent: {
    type: "BlockStatement",
    parent: {
type: "FunctionDeclaration",
      parent: {
        type: "Program",
parent: null,
      },
    },
},
};

console.log(checkFunctionLevel(functionNode)); // Outputs: "contained in
a function"
In this example, we create a functionNode object that represents a
function declaration contained in another function. We call the
checkFunctionLevel() function with functionNode as its parameter, and it returns
"contained in a function".
