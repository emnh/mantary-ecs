Prompt: 1 / 1Define a drawPlatform with the same arguments as drawRectangle
except it takes an image instead of a color.
Answer: 1 / 1Certainly! Here's an
example of a drawPlatform function that takes an image parameter instead of a
color parameter:javascriptCopy codefunction drawPlatform(game, x, y, width,
height, image) {
  const platform = new me.Sprite(x, y, { image: image });
platform.anchorPoint.set(0, 0);
  platform.width = width;
  platform.height =
height;
  game.addChild(platform);
}
This drawPlatform function works similarly
to the drawRectangle function, except that it takes an additional image
parameter. This parameter should be a path to the image file to use for the
platform.Inside the function, a new me.Sprite object is created with the
specified x and y coordinates, and the image parameter is passed in as an object
with the image property set to the image path. The anchorPoint property is set
to (0, 0) to ensure that the sprite is aligned with the specified x and y
coordinates.The width and height of the platform are set to the specified width
and height parameters, and the platform is added to the game object using
game.addChild(platform).Note that this code assumes that the specified image
parameter is a valid path to an image file. You may need to modify this code to
fit your specific use case.
