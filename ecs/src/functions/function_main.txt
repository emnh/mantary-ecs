Prompt: 1 / 1Rewrite main to await loadMelonJS and set the variable me.
Answer:
1 / 1Certainly! Here's an updated main function that uses await to wait for
loadMelonJS to complete and sets the me variable:javascriptCopy codeasync
function main() {
  try {
    await loadMelonJS();
    console.log('melonJS has
been loaded!');
    const me = window.me; // assuming that melonJS exposes
itself as a global variable
    // additional code can be added here to use
melonJS
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}

main();
This main
function is now marked as async, which allows us to use the await keyword to
wait for the loadMelonJS Promise to complete. Once the Promise resolves, we log
a message to the console indicating that melonJS has been loaded, set the me
variable to the global window.me object (assuming that melonJS exposes itself in
this way), and any additional code can be added below it to use the melonJS
library. If there is an error loading melonJS, the catch block will be executed
and the error will be logged to the console.
