Prompt: 1 / 1now create a js main that calls a function that doesn't
exist
Answer: 1 / 1Sure, here's an example of how you could create a main()
function in JavaScript that calls a function that doesn't exist:javascriptCopy
codefunction main() {
  nonExistentFunction();
}

main();
This code defines a
main() function that calls a function named nonExistentFunction, which does not
exist.When the main() function is called, it will attempt to execute
nonExistentFunction(). Since this function does not exist, a ReferenceError will
be thrown.This error will stop the execution of the script and print an error
message to the console. Depending on the environment where the code is running,
the error message may be displayed in a dialog box or other error reporting
interface.
