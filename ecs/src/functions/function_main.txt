Prompt: 1 / 1In the main function, set async to false and add a type
text/javascript
Answer: 1 / 1Sure! Here's an updated version of the main
function with async set to false and the type attribute set to
text/javascript:javascriptCopy codefunction main() {
  const script =
document.createElement("script");
  script.src = "https://esm.run/melonjs";
script.async = false;
  script.type = "text/javascript";
  script.onload =
function () {
    example();
  };
  document.head.appendChild(script);
}
Setting
async to false ensures that the script is loaded synchronously, which means that
the browser will wait for the script to finish loading and executing before
moving on to the next line of code.Setting the type attribute to
"text/javascript" is not strictly necessary, since "text/javascript" is the
default value for the type attribute. However, it's good practice to be explicit
about the type of script being loaded.
