Prompt: 1 / 1Do not use a global variable. Append a call to initializeMelonJS to
main.
Answer: 1 / 1Certainly! Here's an updated initializeMelonJS function that
doesn't use a global variable, and an updated main function that calls
initializeMelonJS before calling drawRectangle:javascriptCopy codefunction
initializeMelonJS(callback) {
  const game = new me.Game({
    renderer:
me.CanvasRenderer,
    width: 640,
    height: 480,
    parent:
'game-container',
    title: 'My MelonJS Game'
  });

  // Load any assets here
// me.loader.preload({/*...*/});

  // Start the game
  game.start();
callback(game);
}

function drawRectangle(game, x, y, width, height, color) {
const rect = new me.Renderable(x, y, width, height);
  rect.draw =
function(renderer) {
    renderer.setColor(color);
renderer.fillRect(this.pos.x, this.pos.y, this.width, this.height);
  };
game.world.addChild(rect);
}

function main() {
  initializeMelonJS((game) => {
drawRectangle(game, 100, 100, 50, 50, '#FF0000');
  });
}

main();
The
initializeMelonJS function now takes a callback function as a parameter, which
is called with the game object once it has been created. This allows us to pass
the game object to other functions without needing to use a global variable.The
drawRectangle function now takes the game object as its first parameter, and
this object is passed to it when it is called from the main function. Note that
initializeMelonJS is called first in the main function and the drawRectangle
function is called from the callback passed to it. This ensures that melonJS is
fully initialized before attempting to draw anything on the screen.
