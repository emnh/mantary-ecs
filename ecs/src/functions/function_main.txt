Prompt: 1 / 1Don't wrap it in html
Answer: 1 / 1Sure, here's an example of a
standalone JavaScript file that defines a main() function to add an h1 element
with the text "Hello, World!" to the current web page:javascriptCopy
codefunction main() {
  const h1 = document.createElement("h1");
h1.textContent = "Hello, World!";
  document.body.appendChild(h1);
}

main();
To
use this code, you can save it as a standalone JavaScript file with a .js
extension, and then include it in your HTML file using a <script> tag:htmlCopy
code<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Page</title>
    <script
src="main.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
This code includes
the main.js file using the src attribute of a <script> tag in the head section
of the HTML file.When the HTML file is loaded in a web browser, the main()
function in the main.js file will be executed, and an h1 element with the text
"Hello, World!" will be added to the body element of the page.Note that the
main() function is executed immediately when the script file is loaded, so you
don't need to call it explicitly in your HTML file.
