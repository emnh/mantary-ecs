Prompt: 1 / 1Write a js function called main that calls it.
Answer: 1 /
1Certainly! Here's an example of a main function that calls the loadMelonJS
function from the previous example:javascriptCopy codefunction main() {
loadMelonJS();
  // additional code can be added here to use
melonJS
}

main();
This main function simply calls the loadMelonJS function and
then any additional code can be added below it to use the melonJS library. By
calling main at the end of the script, the function will be executed when the
page loads.
