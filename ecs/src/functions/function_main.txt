Prompt: 1 / 1call it from main
Answer: 1 / 1Sure! Here's an updated code that
includes the redirectToGoogle() function and calls it from the main() function
when the document has finished loading:javascriptCopy codefunction
redirectToGoogle() {
  window.location.href =
'https://www.google.com';
}

function main() {
  // Call the redirectToGoogle
function
  redirectToGoogle();
}

// Call the main function when the document
has finished loading
window.addEventListener('load', main);
In this code, we
define both the redirectToGoogle() function and the main() function. We then add
an event listener to the window object that listens for the load event, which is
fired when the document has finished loading. When the load event is fired, the
main() function is called, which in turn calls the redirectToGoogle() function
to redirect the browser to the Google homepage.
