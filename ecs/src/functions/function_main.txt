Prompt: 1 / 1Create a main function that throws an error.
Answer: 1 / 1Sure,
here's an example of how you could create a main() function that throws an error
in JavaScript:javascriptCopy codefunction main() {
  throw new Error("Something
went wrong!");
}

main();
This code defines a main() function that throws a new
Error object with a message of "Something went wrong!". The main() function is
then called immediately after it is defined, which causes the error to be
thrown.When the error is thrown, it will stop the execution of the script and
print an error message to the console. Depending on the environment where the
code is running, the error message may be displayed in a dialog box or other
error reporting interface.You can customize the error message by changing the
string passed to the Error constructor. You can also customize the type of error
thrown by using a different subclass of Error, such as TypeError or
ReferenceError.
