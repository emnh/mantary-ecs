Prompt: 1 / 1Rewrite main to output goodbye world
Answer: 1 / 1Sure, here's an
updated version of the main() function that adds an h1 element with the text
"Goodbye, World!" to the current web page:javascriptCopy codefunction main() {
const h1 = document.createElement("h1");
  h1.textContent = "Goodbye, World!";
document.body.appendChild(h1);
}

main();
This code is identical to the previous
example, except that it sets the textContent property of the h1 element to
"Goodbye, World!" instead of "Hello, World!".When you load the updated HTML file
that includes this script in your web browser, it will display an h1 element
with the text "Goodbye, World!" on the page.Note that in a real-world
application, you would typically define more complex functions and include more
code in your JavaScript file. This example is just meant to demonstrate how to
define a standalone main() function in JavaScript that adds an h1 element to the
page.
