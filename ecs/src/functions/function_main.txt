Prompt: 1 / 1in the main 
Answer: 1 / 1Sure, here's an example of how you could
include the code to change the background color to red in the main()
function:javascriptCopy codefunction main() {
document.body.style.backgroundColor = "red";
}

main();
This code defines a
main() function that sets the backgroundColor property of the body element to
"red". The main() function is called immediately when the script file is loaded,
so the background color will be changed to red as soon as the page is loaded in
the browser.You can save this code in a standalone JavaScript file or include it
in a <script> tag in your HTML file, depending on your needs.Note that if you
want to change the background color dynamically based on user input or other
events, you'll need to define event handlers or other code to respond to those
events and change the background color accordingly.
