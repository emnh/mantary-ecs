Prompt: 1 / 1Implement tic tac toe in main
Answer: 1 / 1Sure, here's an example
of how you could implement a simple tic-tac-toe game using JavaScript in the
main() function:javascriptCopy codefunction main() {
  // Create a 3x3 grid for
the game board
  const board = [
    ["", "", ""],
    ["", "", ""],
    ["",
"", ""]
  ];

  // Create a function to display the game board on the page
function render() {
    // Clear the existing board from the page
document.body.innerHTML = "";

    // Create a table element for the new board
const table = document.createElement("table");

    // Add cells to the table
for each position on the board
    for (let i = 0; i < board.length; i++) {
const row = document.createElement("tr");
      for (let j = 0; j <
board[i].length; j++) {
        const cell = document.createElement("td");
cell.textContent = board[i][j];
        cell.addEventListener("click", () =>
{
          // Handle cell clicks by updating the board and re-rendering
if (board[i][j] === "") {
            board[i][j] = "X";
render();
            computerTurn();
          }
        });
row.appendChild(cell);
      }
      table.appendChild(row);
    }

    // Add
the new board to the page
    document.body.appendChild(table);
  }

  // Create
a function for the computer's turn
  function computerTurn() {
    // Randomly
choose a position on the board that is not already taken
    let i, j;
    do {
i = Math.floor(Math.random() * board.length);
      j =
Math.floor(Math.random() * board[i].length);
    } while (board[i][j] !== "");
// Set the position to "O" and re-render the board
    board[i][j] = "O";
render();
  }

  // Start the game by rendering the initial board
render();
}

main();
This code creates a 3x3 game board using a 2-dimensional
array, where each element represents a position on the board. It defines a
render() function to display the current state of the board on the page, and an
event listener for each cell on the board that handles user clicks and updates
the board accordingly.The code also defines a computerTurn() function to handle
the computer's turn. The function randomly chooses an empty position on the
board and sets it to "O".The main() function starts the game by calling render()
to display the initial state of the board.Note that this is just a simple
example, and there are many ways you could extend or modify this code to add
more features or make it more complex. Additionally, you may want to add more
styles to the game board to make it more visually appealing.
