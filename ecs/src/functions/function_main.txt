Prompt: 1 / 1update main
Answer: 1 / 1Sure, to update the main() function to
change the background color to blue, you can modify the code as
follows:javascriptCopy codefunction main() {
document.body.style.backgroundColor = "blue";
}

main();
This code defines a
main() function that sets the backgroundColor property of the body element to
"blue". The main() function is called immediately when the script file is
loaded, so the background color will be changed to blue as soon as the page is
loaded in the browser.You can save this code in a standalone JavaScript file or
include it in a <script> tag in your HTML file, depending on your needs.Note
that if you want to change the background color dynamically based on user input
or other events, you'll need to define event handlers or other code to respond
to those events and change the background color accordingly.
