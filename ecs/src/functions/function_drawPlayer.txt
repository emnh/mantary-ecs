Prompt: 1 / 1Now give me the drawPlayer function.
Answer: 1 / 1Sure! Here's the
drawPlayer function that draws a player sprite on the screen:javascriptCopy
codefunction drawPlayer(container, x, y, width, height, image) {
  const player
= new me.Sprite(x, y, {
    image: image,
    framewidth: 64,
    frameheight:
64
  });

  player.scale(width / player.width, height / player.height);
container.addChild(player);
}
The drawPlayer function takes the following
arguments:container: The container to add the player sprite to.x: The
x-coordinate of the top-left corner of the player sprite.y: The y-coordinate of
the top-left corner of the player sprite.width: The desired width of the player
sprite.height: The desired height of the player sprite.image: The image to use
for the player sprite.The function creates a new instance of me.Sprite with the
specified image and frame size, scales the sprite to the desired width and
height, and adds it to the specified container using container.addChild.
