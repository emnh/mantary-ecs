Prompt: 1 / 1Write a js function that loads Prism syntax highlighter by
injecting into the page
Answer: 1 / 1Sure, here's an example JavaScript function
that loads the Prism syntax highlighter by injecting it into the
page:javascriptCopy codefunction loadPrism() {
  const prismStylesheet =
document.createElement("link");
  prismStylesheet.setAttribute("rel",
"stylesheet");
  prismStylesheet.setAttribute("href",
"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/prismjs/themes/prism.css");
document.head.appendChild(prismStylesheet);

  const prismScript =
document.createElement("script");
  prismScript.setAttribute("src",
"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/prismjs/prism.js");
document.head.appendChild(prismScript);
}
In this example, the loadPrism()
function creates two new elements using the createElement() method of the
document object. The first element is a link element that sets the rel attribute
to "stylesheet" and the href attribute to the CDN link for the Prism CSS
stylesheet. The link element is then appended to the head element of the HTML
page using the appendChild() method.The second element is a script element that
sets the src attribute to the CDN link for the Prism JavaScript file. The script
element is also appended to the head element of the HTML page using the
appendChild() method.Together, these elements load the Prism syntax highlighter
into the HTML page by injecting the necessary CSS and JavaScript files.You can
call this function by running it in a JavaScript environment that has access to
the HTML document object, such as a web browser. When the function is called, it
injects the Prism syntax highlighter into the HTML page by adding the necessary
CSS and JavaScript files to the head element. Once loaded, you can use Prism to
highlight code syntax on the page.
