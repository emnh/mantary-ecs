Prompt: 1 / 1Rename main to loadDependencies. Write a new function called main
which calls loadDependencies.
Answer: 1 / 1Certainly! Here's an updated
loadDependencies function and a new main function that calls it:javascriptCopy
codeasync function loadDependencies() {
  try {
    await loadMelonJS();
console.log('melonJS has been loaded!');
    const me = window.me; // assuming
that melonJS exposes itself as a global variable
    // additional code can be
added here to use melonJS
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
}
}

function main() {
  loadDependencies();
}

main();
Saved mainThis code
renames the previous main function to loadDependencies and creates a new main
function that simply calls loadDependencies. By doing this, we can have a clear
separation between the code that loads our dependencies and the code that uses
them.Note that the loadDependencies function still uses await and is marked as
async, allowing us to wait for the loadMelonJS Promise to complete before
continuing with any additional code.
