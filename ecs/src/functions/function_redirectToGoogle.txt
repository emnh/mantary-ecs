Prompt: 1 / 1Write a js function that redirects to google.
Answer: 1 / 1Sure!
Here's a JavaScript function that redirects the browser to the Google
homepage:javascriptCopy codefunction redirectToGoogle() {
  window.location.href
= 'https://www.google.com';
}
In this code, we define a function called
redirectToGoogle() that sets the window.location.href property to the URL of the
Google homepage. This causes the browser to navigate to that URL, effectively
redirecting the user to the Google homepage.You can call this function from
anywhere in your JavaScript code to redirect the user to Google. For example,
you could add a button to your HTML page with an onclick attribute that calls
the function:htmlCopy code<button onclick="redirectToGoogle()">Go to
Google</button>
When the button is clicked, the redirectToGoogle() function will
be executed and the browser will be redirected to the Google homepage.
