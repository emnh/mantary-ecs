Prompt: 1 / 1I think you need to use addShape, but maybe the body has already
been defined. And don't forget to wrap the class in a function.
Answer: 1 /
1You're correct! The this.body.setShape is not a function error is occurring
because the setShape method is not defined on the body property of the
PlayerEntity instance. The addShape method should be used instead.Here's an
updated version of the getPlayerEntity function that defines the PlayerEntity
class within it, uses the addShape method to set the shape of the me.Body
instance, and returns the PlayerEntity class:javascriptCopy codefunction
getPlayerEntity(me) {
  class PlayerEntity extends me.Entity {
constructor(x, y, settings) {
      super(x, y, settings);

      this.speed =
5;

      if (settings.image) {
settings.image.addEventListener("loaded", () => {
this.renderable.addAnimation("stand", [0]);
this.renderable.addAnimation("walk", [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], 80);
this.renderable.setCurrentAnimation("stand");
        });
      }

      if
(this.body) {
        this.body.addShape(new me.Rect(0, 0, 32, 64));
      }
}

    // ...
  }

  return PlayerEntity;
}
To use the getPlayerEntity function
to get the PlayerEntity class, you can call it and pass in the me object, like
this:javascriptCopy codeconst PlayerEntity = getPlayerEntity(me);
Make sure to
import the me object and call me.boot() before using getPlayerEntity.Also, don't
forget to wrap the PlayerEntity class definition inside a function to make it
more modular and reusable.
