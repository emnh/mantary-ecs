Prompt: 1 / 1TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading
'addEventListener')
Answer: 1 / 1If you're seeing a TypeError: Cannot read
properties of null (reading 'addEventListener') error, it means that the image
property of the settings object passed to the PlayerEntity constructor is
null.To fix this error, you should make sure that the image property is
correctly defined in the settings object passed to the PlayerEntity
constructor.If you're still having trouble, it could be helpful to add some
logging statements to your code to help you track down where the error is
occurring. For example, you could add a console.log statement in the
getPlayerEntity function to log the settings object passed to the
constructor:javascriptCopy codefunction getPlayerEntity(me) {
  class
PlayerEntity extends me.Entity {
    constructor(x, y, settings) {
super(x, y, settings);
      console.log("settings:", settings);
      // ...
}

    // ...
  }

  return PlayerEntity;
}
This should log the settings object
to the console when the PlayerEntity is created, which could help you identify
any issues with the image property.Once you've identified the issue, you can
modify the settings object to ensure that the image property is correctly
defined.
