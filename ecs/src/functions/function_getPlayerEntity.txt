Prompt: 1 / 1lonjs.module.js:37072 Uncaught (in promise) Error: height and width
properties are mandatory when passing settings parameters to an object entity
Answer: 1 / 1This error is being caused because the PlayerEntity class is
missing the width and height properties in the super call of its constructor.
These properties are mandatory when passing settings parameters to an object
entity in MelonJS.To fix the error, you need to add settings.width and
settings.height to the super call of the PlayerEntity constructor. Here's the
updated implementation of getPlayerEntity that includes these
properties:javascriptCopy codefunction getPlayerEntity() {
  class PlayerEntity
extends me.Entity {
    constructor(x, y, settings) {
      super(x, y, {
width: settings.width,
        height: settings.height,
      });
this.renderable = new me.Sprite(0, 0, {
        image: settings.image,
framewidth: 64,
        frameheight: 64
      });
this.renderable.addAnimation("walk", [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]);
this.renderable.setCurrentAnimation("walk");
    }
  }
  return
PlayerEntity;
}
In the updated implementation, getPlayerEntity includes
settings.width and settings.height in the super call of the PlayerEntity
constructor. This ensures that these properties are set correctly and avoids the
error.
