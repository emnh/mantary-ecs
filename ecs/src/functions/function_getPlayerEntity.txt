Prompt: 1 / 1TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading
'addAnimation')
Answer: 1 / 1This error is occurring because addAnimation is
being called on this.renderable, but this.renderable is undefined. This could be
because the image property of the settings object passed to the PlayerEntity
constructor is not being loaded correctly.To fix this error, you can modify the
PlayerEntity constructor to listen for the image load event before calling
addAnimation:javascriptCopy codefunction getPlayerEntity(me) {
  class
PlayerEntity extends me.Entity {
    constructor(x, y, settings) {
super(x, y, settings);
      this.speed = 5;

      // Listen for the image load
event before calling addAnimation
settings.image.addEventListener("loaded", () => {
this.renderable.addAnimation("stand", [0]);
this.renderable.addAnimation("walk", [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], 80);
this.renderable.setCurrentAnimation("stand");
      });
this.body.setShape(new me.Rect(0, 0, 32, 64));
    }

    // ...
  }

  return
PlayerEntity;
}
In this modified code, we've added an event listener to the
image property of the settings object passed to the PlayerEntity constructor.
The event listener waits for the image to load before calling addAnimation on
this.renderable.This should fix the error you're seeing.
