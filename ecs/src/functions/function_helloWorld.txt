Prompt: 1 / 1Write js helloworld2.
Answer: 1 / 1Sure, here's another example of
a JavaScript function that prints "Hello, world!" to an HTML page:javascriptCopy
codefunction helloWorld() {
  const message = document.createElement("p");
message.textContent = "Hello, world!";
document.body.appendChild(message);
}
In this example, the helloWorld() function
creates a new p element using the createElement() method of the document object.
It sets the text content of the p element to "Hello, world!" using the
textContent property. Finally, it appends the p element to the body element of
the HTML page using the appendChild() method.You can call this function by
running it in a JavaScript environment that has access to the HTML document
object, such as a web browser. When the function is called, it creates a new p
element with the text "Hello, world!" and appends it to the body element of the
HTML page. This will cause the message to be displayed on the
page.Alternatively, you can add the following HTML code to an HTML file and
include a reference to your JavaScript file that contains the helloWorld()
function:htmlCopy code<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Hello,
world!</title>
</head>
<body>
  <script
src="path/to/your/javascript/file.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
When you open
this HTML file in a web browser, the JavaScript file will be loaded and the
helloWorld() function will be executed, which will add the "Hello, world!"
message to the HTML page.
