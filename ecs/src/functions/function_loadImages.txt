Prompt: 1 / 1Create an async function loadImages that takes an array of image
URLs and returns a dictionary of images retrieved with getImage. 
Answer: 1 /
1Sure! Here's an implementation of an async function called loadImages that
takes an array of image URLs and returns a dictionary of images retrieved with
the getImage function:javascriptCopy codeasync function loadImages(imageUrls) {
const images = {};
  for (const imageUrl of imageUrls) {
    const image =
await getImage(imageUrl);
    if (!image) {
      console.error(`Failed to load
image from URL: ${imageUrl}`);
      continue;
    }
    images[imageUrl] =
image;
  }
  return images;
}
In this implementation, the loadImages function
takes an array of image URLs as its argument.The function creates an empty
images object to store the loaded images.For each image URL in the imageUrls
array, the function calls the getImage function to load the image as a Promise.
If the Promise resolves to an image object, the function adds the image object
to the images object using the URL as the key. If the Promise is rejected or the
image object is falsy, the function logs an error message to the console and
continues to the next image URL.Finally, the function returns the images object
containing the loaded images.This implementation should allow you to load
multiple images asynchronously and store them in a dictionary for later use.
