Prompt: 1 / 1Do we need to call me.boot first?
Answer: 1 / 1It's a good practice
to call me.boot() before any other me.* call, as this initializes some internal
melonJS modules and checks the device features. However, it is not strictly
necessary to call me.boot() before me.device.onReady().The me.device.onReady()
function is designed to be called after the device/browser is ready and provides
a callback function that is called once the device is ready. The
me.device.onReady() function also internally calls me.boot() if it has not been
called yet.In general, it's a good idea to call me.boot() early in your code to
ensure that the melonJS environment is set up correctly. Here's an example of
how you can modify the example() function to call me.boot() before using the me
object:javascriptCopy codefunction example(me) {
  me.boot();
me.device.onReady(function () {
    // initialize the display canvas once the
device/browser is ready
    if (!me.video.init(1218, 562, {parent : "screen",
scale : "auto"})) {
      alert("Your browser does not support HTML5 canvas.");
return;
    }

    // add a gray background to the default Stage
me.game.world.addChild(new me.ColorLayer("background", "#202020"));

    // add
a font text display object
    me.game.world.addChild(new me.Text(609, 281, {
font: "Arial",
      size: 160,
      fillStyle: "#FFFFFF",
textBaseline : "middle",
      textAlign : "center",
      text : "Hello World
!"
    }));
  });
}
In this example, we call me.boot() before using the me
object to ensure that the melonJS environment is set up correctly. We then
define the me.device.onReady() function to initialize the display canvas once
the device/browser is ready.
