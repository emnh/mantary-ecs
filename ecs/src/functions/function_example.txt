Prompt: 1 / 1Why do you think the me object doesn't exist? Could it be that it's
called something else, like melonjs?
Answer: 1 / 1Yes, you're correct! It's
possible that the melonjs library is loaded with a different variable name
instead of me.In that case, you should replace the window.me with the
appropriate variable name that is used to access the melonjs library.For
example, if the melonjs library is loaded with the variable name melonjs, you
would need to replace window.me with window.melonjs.Here's an updated version of
the example function that uses window.melonjs to access the melonjs
library:javascriptCopy codefunction example() {
  if (!window.melonjs) {
console.error("melonjs is not properly loaded.");
    return;
  }
  
  const
melonjs = window.melonjs;

  melonjs.device.onReady(function () {
    //
initialize the display canvas once the device/browser is ready
    if
(!melonjs.video.init(1218, 562, {parent : "screen", scale : "auto"})) {
alert("Your browser does not support HTML5 canvas.");
      return;
    }
// add a gray background to the default Stage
melonjs.game.world.addChild(new melonjs.ColorLayer("background", "#202020"));
// add a font text display object
    melonjs.game.world.addChild(new
melonjs.Text(609, 281, {
      font: "Arial",
      size: 160,
      fillStyle:
"#FFFFFF",
      textBaseline : "middle",
      textAlign : "center",
      text
: "Hello World !"
    }));
  });
}
In this example, we replaced window.me with
window.melonjs, and updated the variable names to use melonjs instead of me.
This ensures that we are accessing the melonjs library with the correct variable
name.
