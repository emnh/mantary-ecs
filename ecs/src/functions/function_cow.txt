Prompt: 1 / 1Write a js cow function that says moo.
Answer: 1 / 1Sure, here's a
simple JavaScript function that creates a cow object with a moo() method that
logs the message "moo" to the console:javascriptCopy codefunction cow() {
const cowObject = {
    moo: function() {
      console.log("moo");
    }
  };
return cowObject;
}
When you call the cow() function, it returns a cow object
that has a moo() method. You can call the moo() method on the cow object to make
it say "moo":javascriptCopy codeconst myCow = cow(); // create a new cow
object
myCow.moo(); // logs "moo" to the console
Of course, you can modify this
function to do something else with the "moo" message, such as displaying it on
the screen or speaking it out loud using a text-to-speech library.
